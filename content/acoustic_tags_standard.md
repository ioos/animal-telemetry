+++




*The purpose of this document is to describe the data and metadata template to use to share acoustic, archival and satellite telemetry data between organizations. The need for such a standard has become obvious due to a growing number of projects (e.g. TOPP, POST, AATAMS) collecting important volumes of data (Kranstauber et al. 2011, Campbell et al. 2015, Dwyer et al. 2015, Campbell et al. 2016), which are more likely to result in the publication of articles in high impact factor journals (Block et al. 2011, Hussey et al. 2015, Kays et al. 2015).* 
<!--more-->

*The standard proposed hereafter is primarily based on the metadata convention developed for acoustic telemetry projects (Payne et al. 2013) and the structure of the IMOS Animal Tracking acoustic database (IMOS Animal Tracking 2016), with additional metadata information gathered from various projects (e.g. OTN, TOPP, Movebank) (Kranstauber et al. 2011). The present convention follows the nomenclature used in Payne et al. (2013) with database fields flagged as ‘required’ or ‘optional’ for users to get a minimum amount of viable information for each dataset. Constraints and relationships between database tables highlight how information from different tables can be respectively kept consistent and joined together (Figure 1). For additional database related logic, refer to Payne et al. (2013). The proposed tables were designed using the PostgreSQL database language and the PostGIS extension to convert longitude/latitude coordinates into geometries. All PostgreSQL queries along with other documents relevant to this standard are publicly available at https://github.com/xhoenner/biologging_data-sharing.*

# 1. Database schema design

All metadata related to individual tag or receiver deployments (the equivalent of global attributes for netCDF files) are stored in 13 different tables detailed below and in [Section 3](#database-schema). In contrast, metadata for each variable in a dataset, commonly referred to as variable attributes in the netCDF format, are not included in the current standard but may be added in the future if required. The present data exchange standard also includes a database structure to hold animal location data estimated from Argos, Fastloc GPS, light levels, and acoustic receivers. These location datasets are stored in four distinct tables because of different diagnostic information inherent to each technology. Furthermore two monitoring tables store information about metadata editing and data file uploads.

Detailed field names and meanings for each database table are provided in [Section 3](#database-schema). Each table has (1) a primary key, which constrains some fields to have a unique combination of values, and (2) foreign keys, which explicitly link tables so that information from different tables can be extracted in a flat CSV table format. These foreign keys also prevent accidental deletion and erroneous insertion of data. Database views can then be built to join information between tables and subsequently be used by a web-based application.

## 1.1 Metadata tables

1.  [**Device**](#device): information about tags including manufacturer name and model.

2.  [**Instrument**](#instruments): additional information about each tag, *e.g.* firmware/software version, tag configuration, on board sensors.

3.  [**Installation station**](#installation-station): information about acoustic installations and stations within installations.

4.  [**Receiver deployment and recovery**](#receiver-deployment-recovery): information about     acoustic receiver deployments and recoveries.

5.  [**Surgery**](#surgery): specifies which tag was deployed as part of an animal release and how. This is a mapping table between the `device` and `animal_release_recovery` tables allowing multiple tag deployments.

6.  [**Animal release and recovery**](#animal-release-recovery): information about animal capture, release, and potential recovery.

7.  [**Animal**](#animal): information about each animal equipped with tags including sex, species, and age.

8.  [**Species**](#species): read-only table providing a list of species for users to choose from. This list should eventually follow a comprehensive standard approved upon by the tagging community (_e.g._ [WoRMS for marine species](http://www.marinespecies.org/)).

9.  [**Animal measurement**](#animal-measurement): lists all the morphological measurements taken for each tagged animal.

10. [**Project**](#project): information on tagging projects (_e.g._ abstract, distribution statement), and which data center hosts their data (if any).

11. [**Data center**](#data-center): name and attributes of each data center.

12. [**Users**](#user): names and contact details of users.

13. [**Project role**](#projectp-role): mapping table between the project and users tables.


## 1.2 Monitoring tables

1.  [**Activity log**](#activity-log): lists modifications made by users through the GUI to metadata tables.

2.  [**Uploaded files**](#uploaded-files): lists all data files uploaded by users.


## 1.3 Data tables

1.  [**GPS locations**](#gps-locations): animal location data and diagnostic information obtained using the Fastloc GPS technology.

2.  [**Argos locations**](#argos-locations): animal location data and diagnostic information obtained using the Argos technology.

3.  [**GLS locations**](#gls-locations): animal location data obtained using light level sensor tags.

4.  [**Acoustic detections**](#acoustic-detections): animal location data and sensor values obtained from acoustic receivers.

# 2. Discussion


## 2.1 Infrastructure

We propose that the relational database tables described above be supported by an online, web-based interface for users to enter/edit metadata, upload data, and search, filter and download data. These three use cases should dictate the overall design of the graphical user interface (GUI) to make it as intuitive as possible to users.
To avoid hosting data without a minimum amount of metadata, an error should be generated when uploading data files for tags that are not registered in the database with the exception of acoustic data for which tags detected are not necessarily owned by receiver owners. A key requirement will therefore be for users to register their tags using the exact same name as in their data files so that observations can be internally joined with tag and deployment metadata.
While duplicate observations can be flagged directly within the database using PostgreSQL functions, all data files for upload via the GUI (*e.g.* GPS locations, acoustic detections) will have to follow clearly defined conventions. Tools may therefore have to be developed to convert data files provided by each manufacturer into the required format and checkers should be set up within the web application so that bad and uncompliant data does not end up in the database. Hosting additional data products (_e.g._ CTD or TDR data, receiver events) is consequently feasible but will require additional work on conversion tools and compliance checkers.

<br>
## 2.2 Data flow

The following section explains the proposed flow of data in the system covering the three use cases outlined above: *i.e.* metadata editing, data upload, data download. Unregistered users will only have access to the latter section while registered users (*e.g.* system administrator, principal investigator) who are member of a given project will also be able to enter metadata and upload data files. A security logic restricting access to sensitive data (*e.g.* PhD projects, species at risk of being targeted for exploitation) could be implemented similarly to the one in place in the [IMOS Animal Tracking web application](https://github.com/aodn/aatams). Doing so will nonetheless add substantial complexity to the online infrastructure code and hence increase its maintenance cost greatly.


### *Metadata entry*

This menu option will only be available to registered users who are members of a project. This menu consists of a logical sequence of questions:

1.  *Does your project exist in the database?*

   - **No ->** user is prompted to enter details about their project.

   - **Yes ->** user can edit project details and/or proceed to Step 2.

2.  *Does your device exist in the database?*

    - **No ->** user is prompted to enter details about their device and instruments.

    - **Yes ->** user can edit device and instruments details and/or proceed to Step 3 if the device has been deployed or recovered.

3.  *Does a deployment/recovery event exist for this device in the database?*

     - **No ->** user is prompted to enter details about tag deployment and/or recovery on an animal, animal information (species, measurements) **OR** receiver deployment and/or recovery on an acoustic installation/station.

     - **Yes ->** user can edit tag or receiver deployment/recovery details and/or proceed to Step 4.

4.  *What do you want to do next?*

     - Register a new tag in the database proceed to Step 2.

     - Add other deployment/recovery information proceed to Step 3.

     - Upload data files see next section.



### *Data upload*

This menu option will only be available to registered users who are members of a project.

1.  Users will first be asked which type of data file they would like to upload and be reminded of (a) the expected file format convention and (b) that all tag IDs in their data file must have a matching record in the database (except in the case of acoustic data files, see second paragraph of the Discussion).

2.  Users will then be able to upload their data file. A checker will verify that the file format complies with the expected convention and that all tag IDs in the data file are found under the `device_name` field in the `device` table.

3.  Three outcomes are then possible:

   - Data file successfully passed all tests.

   - One or more tests of the data file checker have failed; error messages should be shown to users accordingly.

   - Some tag IDs (or receiver IDs) are not found under the `device_name` field in the `device` table: users should be given a list of unknown tag IDs and be prompted to enter tag and deployment metadata for those tags.

### *Data download*

This menu option will be available to unregistered users but data availability may vary depending on whether we choose to implement security constraints. Users should be able to subset and download data using the following filters:

-   Data type, *e.g.* GPS location, acoustic detections

-   Date start and end

-   Geographic bounding box

-   Species

-   Tag IDs

-   Project name
